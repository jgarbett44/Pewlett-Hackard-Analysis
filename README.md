# **Pewlett-Hackard Employee Analysis**

## Overview

Pewlett-Hackard is a large company that has been in business for many years. As a result, they have an aging workforce and they expect a large number of employees to retire in the near future. To be prepared, we will analyze data, looking at who is retiring and at what positions will need to be filled.

## Preparation

A flowchart, or ERD (entity relationship diagram), was created to begin to map the data:
